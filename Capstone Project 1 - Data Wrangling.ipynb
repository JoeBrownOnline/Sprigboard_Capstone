      "down to the parlour, dressed for mass, his father had cried. That was\r\n",

      "THAT HE WERE CAST INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA RATHER THAN THAT HE SHOULD\r\n",

      "gentleman...\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "strangers down too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He looked round at the others whose faces were bent towards their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome face, mind\r\n",

      "cabbage of a cold winter's day. O Johnny!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He twisted his features into a grimace of heavy bestiality and made a\r\n",

      "not right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "too when he grows up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce\r\n",
      "and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against\r\n",

      "convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the\r\n",

      "Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that\r\n",
      "used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of\r\n",

      "HOUSE OF GOLD! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of\r\n",
      "gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the\r\n",

      "fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and\r\n",

      "stage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink light showed\r\n",
      "in the darkness and as he walked towards it he became aware of a faint\r\n",
      "aromatic odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway,\r\n",
      "smoking, and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by his\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Here comes the noble Dedalus! cried a high throaty voice. Welcome to\r\n",
      "our trusty friend!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This welcome ended in a soft peal of mirthless laughter as Heron\r\n",
      "salaamed and then began to poke the ground with his cane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Here I am, said Stephen, halting and glancing from Heron to his\r\n",
      "friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter was a stranger to him but in the darkness, by the aid of the\r\n",
      "glowing cigarette tips, he could make out a pale dandyish face over\r\n",
      "which a smile was travelling slowly, a tall overcoated figure and a\r\n",
      "hard hat. Heron did not trouble himself about an introduction but said\r\n",
      "instead:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be tonight\r\n",
      "if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be\r\n",
      "a ripping good joke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Heron made a poor attempt to imitate for his friend Wallis the rector's\r\n",
      "pedantic bass and then, laughing at his failure, asked Stephen to do\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Go on, Dedalus, he urged, you can take him off rippingly. HE THAT WILL\r\n",
      "NOT HEAR THE CHURCHA LET HIM BE TO THEEA AS THE HEATHENA AND THE\r\n",
      "PUBLICANA.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The imitation was prevented by a mild expression of anger from Wallis\r\n",
      "in whose mouthpiece the cigarette had become too tightly wedged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Damn this blankety blank holder, he said, taking it from his mouth\r\n",
      "and smiling and frowning upon it tolerantly. It's always getting stuck\r\n",
      "like that. Do you use a holder?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I don't smoke, answered Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--No, said Heron, Dedalus is a model youth. He doesn't smoke and he\r\n",
      "doesn't go to bazaars and he doesn't flirt and he doesn't damn anything\r\n",
      "or damn all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and mobile\r\n",
      "face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it strange that\r\n",
      "Vincent Heron had a bird's face as well as a bird's name. A shock of\r\n",
      "pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was\r\n",
      "narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the close-set\r\n",
      "prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive. The rivals were\r\n",
      "school friends. They sat together in class, knelt together in the\r\n",
      "chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As the fellows\r\n",
      "in number one were undistinguished dullards, Stephen and Heron had been\r\n",
      "during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went\r\n",
      "up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--O by the way, said Heron suddenly, I saw your governor going in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The smile waned on Stephen's face. Any allusion made to his father by a\r\n",
      "fellow or by a master put his calm to rout in a moment. He waited in\r\n",
      "timorous silence to hear what Heron might say next. Heron, however,\r\n",
      "nudged him expressively with his elbow and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You're a sly dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Why so? said Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You'd think butter wouldn't melt in your mouth said Heron. But I'm\r\n",
      "afraid you're a sly dog.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Might I ask you what you are talking about? said Stephen urbanely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Indeed you might, answered Heron. We saw her, Wallis, didn't we? And\r\n",
      "deucedly pretty she is too. And inquisitive! AND WHAT PART DOES STEPHEN\r\n",
      "TAKE, MR DEDALUS? AND WILL STEPHEN NOT SING, MR DEDALUS? Your governor\r\n",
      "was staring at her through that eyeglass of his for all he was worth so\r\n",
      "that I think the old man has found you out too. I wouldn't care a bit,\r\n",
      "by Jove. She's ripping, isn't she, Wallis?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not half bad, answered Wallis quietly as he placed his holder once\r\n",
      "more in a corner of his mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shaft of momentary anger flew through Stephen's mind at these\r\n",
      "indelicate allusions in the hearing of a stranger. For him there was\r\n",
      "nothing amusing in a girl's interest and regard. All day he had thought\r\n",
      "of nothing but their leave-taking on the steps of the tram at Harold's\r\n",
      "Cross, the stream of moody emotions it had made to course through him\r\n",
      "and the poem he had written about it. All day he had imagined a new\r\n",
      "meeting with her for he knew that she was to come to the play. The old\r\n",
      "restless moodiness had again filled his breast as it had done on the\r\n",
      "night of the party, but had not found an outlet in verse. The growth\r\n",
      "and knowledge of two years of boyhood stood between then and now,\r\n",
      "forbidding such an outlet: and all day the stream of gloomy tenderness\r\n",
      "within him had started forth and returned upon itself in dark courses\r\n",
      "and eddies, wearying him in the end until the pleasantry of the prefect\r\n",
      "and the painted little boy had drawn from him a movement of impatience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--So you may as well admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly found you\r\n",
      "out this time. You can't play the saint on me any more, that's one sure\r\n",
      "five.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A soft peal of mirthless laughter escaped from his lips and, bending\r\n",
      "down as before, he struck Stephen lightly across the calf of the leg\r\n",
      "with his cane, as if in jesting reproof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen's moment of anger had already passed. He was neither flattered\r\n",
      "nor confused, but simply wished the banter to end. He scarcely resented\r\n",
      "what had seemed to him a silly indelicateness for he knew that the\r\n",
      "adventure in his mind stood in no danger from these words: and his face\r\n",
      "mirrored his rival's false smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Admit! repeated Heron, striking him again with his cane across the\r\n",
      "calf of the leg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had\r\n",
      "been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost\r\n",
      "painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion's\r\n",
      "jesting mood, began to recite the CONFITEOR. The episode ended well,\r\n",
      "for both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The confession came only from Stephen's lips and, while they spoke the\r\n",
      "words, a sudden memory had carried him to another scene called up, as\r\n",
      "if by magic, at the moment when he had noted the faint cruel dimples at\r\n",
      "the corners of Heron's smiling lips and had felt the familiar stroke of\r\n",
      "the cane against his calf and had heard the familiar word of\r\n",
      "admonition:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Admit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was towards the close of his first term in the college when he was\r\n",
      "in number six. His sensitive nature was still smarting under the lashes\r\n",
      "of an undivined and squalid way of life. His soul was still disquieted\r\n",
      "and cast down by the dull phenomenon of Dublin. He had emerged from a\r\n",
      "two years' spell of revery to find himself in the midst of a new scene,\r\n",
      "every event and figure of which affected him intimately, disheartened\r\n",
      "him or allured and, whether alluring or disheartening, filled him\r\n",
      "always with unrest and bitter thoughts. All the leisure which his\r\n",
      "school life left him was passed in the company of subversive writers\r\n",
      "whose jibes and violence of speech set up a ferment in his brain before\r\n",
      "they passed out of it into his crude writings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The essay was for him the chief labour of his week and every Tuesday,\r\n",
      "as he marched from home to the school, he read his fate in the\r\n",
      "incidents of the way, pitting himself against some figure ahead of him\r\n",
      "and quickening his pace to outstrip it before a certain goal was\r\n",
      "reached or planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the\r\n",
      "patchwork of the pathway and telling himself that he would be first and\r\n",
      "not first in the weekly essay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a certain Tuesday the course of his triumphs was rudely broken. Mr\r\n",
      "Tate, the English master, pointed his finger at him and said bluntly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--This fellow has heresy in his essay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A hush fell on the class. Mr Tate did not break it but dug with his\r\n",
      "hand between his thighs while his heavily starched linen creaked about\r\n",
      "his neck and wrists. Stephen did not look up. It was a raw spring\r\n",
      "morning and his eyes were still smarting and weak. He was conscious of\r\n",
      "failure and of detection, of the squalor of his own mind and home, and\r\n",
      "felt against his neck the raw edge of his turned and jagged collar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A short loud laugh from Mr Tate set the class more at ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Perhaps you didn't know that, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Where? asked Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Tate withdrew his delving hand and spread out the essay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Here. It's about the Creator and the soul. Rrm... rrm... rrm... Ah!\r\n",
      "WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER APPROACHING NEARER. That's heresy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen murmured:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I meant WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY OF EVER REACHING.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a submission and Mr Tate, appeased, folded up the essay and\r\n",
      "passed it across to him, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--O...Ah! EVER REACHING. That's another story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the class was not so soon appeased. Though nobody spoke to him of\r\n",
      "the affair after class he could feel about him a vague general\r\n",
      "malignant joy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few nights after this public chiding he was walking with a letter\r\n",
      "along the Drumcondra Road when he heard a voice cry:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Halt!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned and saw three boys of his own class coming towards him in the\r\n",
      "dusk. It was Heron who had called out and, as he marched forward\r\n",
      "between his two attendants, he cleft the air before him with a thin\r\n",
      "cane in time to their steps. Boland, his friend, marched beside him, a\r\n",
      "large grin on his face, while Nash came on a few steps behind, blowing\r\n",
      "from the pace and wagging his great red head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the boys had turned into Clonliffe Road together they began\r\n",
      "to speak about books and writers, saying what books they were reading\r\n",
      "and how many books there were in their fathers' bookcases at home.\r\n",
      "Stephen listened to them in some wonderment for Boland was the dunce\r\n",

      "favourite writers, Nash declared for Captain Marryat who, he said, was\r\n",
      "the greatest writer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Fudge! said Heron. Ask Dedalus. Who is the greatest writer, Dedalus?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen noted the mockery in the question and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Of prose do you mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--And who is the best poet, Heron? asked Boland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Lord Tennyson, of course, answered Heron.\r\n",

      "yard and were going to be sent to the loft for.\r\n",

      "remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and\r\n",
      "that her dark eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in\r\n",

      "revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden\r\n",

      "aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry\r\n",

      "He could hear the band playing THE LILY OF KILLARNEY and knew that in a\r\n",

      "their image at once swept away his scruples, leaving his will compact.\r\n",
      "Another nature seemed to have been lent him: the infection of the\r\n",
      "excitement and youth about him entered into and transformed his moody\r\n",

      "for a disjointed lifeless thing had suddenly assumed a life of its own.\r\n",
      "It seemed now to play itself, he and his fellow actors aiding it with\r\n",
      "their parts. When the curtain fell on the last scene he heard the void\r\n",
      "filled with applause and, through a rift in a side scene, saw the\r\n",

      "through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over\r\n",
      "his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if\r\n",

      "had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an\r\n",

      "and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and\r\n",
      "shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "find in the outer world a trace of what he had deemed till then a\r\n",
      "brutish and individual malady of his own mind. His monstrous reveries\r\n",
      "came thronging into his memory. They too had sprung up before him,\r\n",
      "suddenly and furiously, out of mere words. He had soon given in to them\r\n",
      "and allowed them to sweep across and abase his intellect, wondering\r\n",
      "always where they came from, from what den of monstrous images, and\r\n",

      "bystreet a German band of five players in faded uniforms and with\r\n",

      "of our mouths. Suddenly the governor passed. He didn't say a word, or\r\n",
      "stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together\r\n",
      "and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:--By\r\n",

      "sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses\r\n",
      "with lakelike spaces of dark rosy light. His very brain was sick and\r\n",
      "powerless. He could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of\r\n",

      "falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him to realize the\r\n",
      "enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred. He bore cynically\r\n",

      "background of his memory. He saw again the small white house and the\r\n",
      "garden of rose-bushes on the road that led to the mountains and he\r\n",
      "remembered the sadly proud gesture of refusal which he was to make\r\n",
      "there, standing with her in the moonlit garden after years of\r\n",
      "estrangement and adventure. At those moments the soft speeches of\r\n",

      "was in revolt. He wandered up and down the dark slimy streets peering\r\n",
      "into the gloom of lanes and doorways, listening eagerly for any sound.\r\n",
      "He moaned to himself like some baffled prowling beast. He wanted to sin\r\n",
      "with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to\r\n",
      "exult with her in sin. He felt some dark presence moving irresistibly\r\n",
      "upon him from the darkness, a presence subtle and murmurous as a flood\r\n",
      "filling him wholly with itself. Its murmur besieged his ears like the\r\n",
      "murmur of some multitude in sleep; its subtle streams penetrated his\r\n",
      "being. His hands clenched convulsively and his teeth set together as he\r\n",
      "suffered the agony of its penetration. He stretched out his arms in the\r\n",
      "street to hold fast the frail swooning form that eluded him and incited\r\n",
      "him: and the cry that he had strangled for so long in his throat issued\r\n",
      "from his lips. It broke from him like a wail of despair from a hell of\r\n",
      "sufferers and died in a wail of furious entreaty, a cry for an\r\n",
      "iniquitous abandonment, a cry which was but the echo of an obscene\r\n",
      "scrawl which he had read on the oozing wall of a urinal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had wandered into a maze of narrow and dirty streets. From the foul\r\n",
      "laneways he heard bursts of hoarse riot and wrangling and the drawling\r\n",
      "of drunken singers. He walked onward, dismayed, wondering whether he\r\n",
      "had strayed into the quarter of the Jews. Women and girls dressed in\r\n",
      "long vivid gowns traversed the street from house to house. They were\r\n",
      "leisurely and perfumed. A trembling seized him and his eyes grew dim.\r\n",
      "The yellow gas-flames arose before his troubled vision against the\r\n",
      "vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before the doors and in the\r\n",
      "lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite. He was in\r\n",
      "another world: he had awakened from a slumber of centuries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "against his bosom in a tumult. A young woman dressed in a long pink\r\n",
      "gown laid her hand on his arm to detain him and gazed into his face.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and he, seeing her face lifted to him in serious calm and feeling the\r\n",
      "warm calm rise and fall of her breast, all but burst into hysterical\r\n",
      "weeping. Tears of joy and relief shone in his delighted eyes and his\r\n",
      "lips parted though they would not speak.\r\n",

      "body and mind, conscious of nothing in the world but the dark pressure\r\n",
      "of her softly parting lips. They pressed upon his brain as upon his\r\n",
      "lips as though they were the vehicle of a vague speech; and between\r\n",

      "book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice which\r\n",
      "was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled, and made no attempt to\r\n",
      "flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such as\r\n",
      "the sharpening of knives on the knife board, the gathering of cinders\r\n",
      "on the fire-shovel and the twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell\r\n",
      "was more difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to\r\n",
      "bad odours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world, such as\r\n",
      "those of dung or tar, or the odours of his own person among which he\r\n",
      "had made many curious comparisons and experiments. He found in the end\r\n",
      "that the only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a\r\n",
      "certain stale fishy stink like that of long-standing urine; and\r\n",
      "whenever it was possible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour.\r\n",
      "To mortify the taste he practised strict habits at table, observed to\r\n",
      "the letter all the fasts of the church and sought by distraction to\r\n",
      "divert his mind from the savours of different foods. But it was to the\r\n",

      "the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and\r\n",
      "pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his knees all through the\r\n",

      "pockets or clasped behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him however to find\r\n",
      "that at the end of his course of intricate piety and self-restraint he\r\n",
      "was so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections. His\r\n",
      "prayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger at\r\n",
      "hearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions. It\r\n",
      "needed an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urged\r\n",
      "him to give outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of\r\n",
      "trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters, their\r\n",
      "twitching mouths, close-shut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his\r\n",
      "memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the\r\n",
      "comparison. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was\r\n",
      "harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant\r\n",
      "failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at\r\n",
      "last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts\r\n",
      "and scruples. His soul traversed a period of desolation in which the\r\n",
      "sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried-up sources. His\r\n",
      "confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented\r\n",
      "imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him\r\n",
      "the same dissolving moments of virginal self-surrender as did those\r\n",
      "spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit\r\n",
      "to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was\r\n",
      "an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with fading\r\n",
      "characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world of fervent love\r\n",
      "and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading\r\n",
      "of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with\r\n",
      "the communicant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the\r\n",
      "soul, telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal\r\n",
      "and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind now that\r\n",

      "which began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations.\r\n",

      "single act of consent, in a moment of thought, undo all that he had\r\n",
      "done. He seemed to feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet\r\n",
      "and to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch\r\n",
      "his fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost at\r\n",
      "the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far away from\r\n",
      "the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of the will or a\r\n",
      "sudden ejaculation; and, seeing the silver line of the flood far away\r\n",
      "and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet, a new thrill of\r\n",
      "power and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yielded\r\n",
      "nor undone all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way he\r\n",

      "certitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded a vague fear\r\n",
      "that his soul had really fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that\r\n",
      "he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling\r\n",
      "himself that he had prayed to God at every temptation and that the\r\n",
      "grace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as\r\n",

      "cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on the\r\n",

      "his mind. Masked memories passed quickly before him: he recognized\r\n",
      "scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceive\r\n",
      "some vital circumstance in them. He saw himself walking about the\r\n",

      "marked off from his companions by his piety, by the good example he\r\n",
      "shows to others. He is looked up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as\r\n",

      "of which angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved\r\n",
      "to muse in secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young\r\n",
      "and silent-mannered priest, entering a confessional swiftly,\r\n",
      "ascending the altarsteps, incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing\r\n",
      "the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of\r\n",
      "their semblance of reality and of their distance from it. In that\r\n",
      "dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had\r\n",
      "assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various\r\n",
      "priests. He had bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had\r\n",
      "shaken the thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had\r\n",
      "swung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar again\r\n",
      "after having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to\r\n",
      "fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He shrank\r\n",
      "from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that\r\n",
      "all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual\r\n",
      "should assign to him so clear and final an office. He longed for the\r\n",
      "minor sacred offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at\r\n",
      "high mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, his\r\n",

      "folds or, when the sacrifice had been accomplished, to stand as deacon\r\n",

      "pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a church without\r\n",
      "worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar, and\r\n",
      "served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague\r\n",
      "sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth\r\n",
      "to encounter reality; and it was partly the absence of an appointed\r\n",
      "rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had\r\n",
      "allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an\r\n",
      "embrace he longed to give.\r\n",

      "offering him secret knowledge and secret power. He would know then what\r\n",
      "was the sin of Simon Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for\r\n",
      "which there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden\r\n",
      "from others, from those who were conceived and born children of wrath.\r\n",
      "He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful thoughts and\r\n",
      "sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured into his ears in the\r\n",

      "imposition of hands, his soul would pass again uncontaminated to the\r\n",
      "white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands\r\n",

      "powerful with God, that God may enlighten your mind. But you must be\r\n",
      "quite sure, Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be\r\n",
      "terrible if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest\r\n",
      "always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament\r\n",
      "of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once because\r\n",
      "it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be\r\n",
      "effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a\r\n",
      "companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out on to the wide\r\n",
      "platform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mild\r\n",
      "evening air. Towards Findlater's church a quartet of young men were\r\n",
      "striding along with linked arms, swaying their heads and stepping to\r\n",
      "the agile melody of their leader's concertina. The music passed in an\r\n",
      "instant, as the first bars of sudden music always did, over the\r\n",
      "fantastic fabrics of his mind, dissolving them painlessly and\r\n",
      "noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolves the sand-built turrets of\r\n",
      "children. Smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's\r\n",

      "self-communion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day\r\n",
      "from the threshold of the college. The shadow, then, of the life of the\r\n",
      "college passed gravely over his consciousness. It was a grave and\r\n",
      "ordered and passionless life that awaited him, a life without material\r\n",
      "cares. He wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiate\r\n",
      "and with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory.\r\n",
      "The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes came back to him\r\n",
      "and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames. At once from\r\n",
      "every part of his being unrest began to irradiate. A feverish\r\n",
      "quickening of his pulses followed, and a din of meaningless words drove\r\n",
      "his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated\r\n",
      "and sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he\r\n",
      "smelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in Clongowes\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than education or\r\n",

      "instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him against acquiescence. The\r\n",
      "chill and order of the life repelled him. He saw himself rising in the\r\n",
      "cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and\r\n",
      "trying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the fainting\r\n",
      "sickness of his stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the\r\n",
      "community of a college. What, then, had become of that deep-rooted\r\n",
      "shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange\r\n",

      "pallid brick red. Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on\r\n",

      "had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened\r\n",
      "to end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the\r\n",
      "director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery\r\n",
      "and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory.\r\n",
      "His soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the\r\n",
      "exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal\r\n",
      "tale. He would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest.\r\n",

      "himself wandering among the snares of the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. Not to fall was\r\n",
      "too hard, too hard; and he felt the silent lapse of his soul, as it\r\n",

      "Virgin which stood fowl-wise on a pole in the middle of a ham-shaped\r\n",
      "encampment of poor cottages. Then, bending to the left, he followed the\r\n",
      "lane which led up to his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages\r\n",
      "came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth.\r\n",
      "He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as\r\n",
      "he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about\r\n",

      "memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet\r\n",
      "branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the\r\n",
      "city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of\r\n",
      "Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman;\r\n",
      "that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the\r\n",

      "doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to\r\n",
      "hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter\r\n",
      "of waist-coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time,\r\n",

      "those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been\r\n",
      "fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes\r\n",
      "of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty\r\n",
      "had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had\r\n",
      "been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of\r\n",
      "silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself\r\n",
      "still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor\r\n",

      "of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the\r\n",
      "green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another\r\n",

      "squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing\r\n",
      "without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about\r\n",

      "before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the\r\n",
      "head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw\r\n",
      "it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head\r\n",
      "or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as\r\n",
      "by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor,\r\n",
      "in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the\r\n",
      "jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly\r\n",

      "the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and\r\n",
      "night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence,\r\n",

      "listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and\r\n",
      "deadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word to\r\n",
      "another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so\r\n",
      "silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl answered\r\n",
      "after an instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing\r\n",
      "and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to\r\n",
      "another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton\r\n",
      "Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged\r\n",
      "poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the\r\n",
      "memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his\r\n",
      "father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of\r\n",
      "tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a\r\n",
      "plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were\r\n",
      "printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and the\r\n",
      "rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising\r\n",
      "upward through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant\r\n",
      "venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a\r\n",
      "faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment\r\n",
      "when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a\r\n",
      "corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall\r\n",
      "and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The\r\n",
      "corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that\r\n",
      "it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck\r\n",
      "Whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit\r\n",
      "house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of\r\n",
      "Tone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light\r\n",
      "that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before\r\n",
      "the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was\r\n",
      "the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly\r\n",
      "and approached the fireplace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Good morning, sir! Can I help you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The priest looked up quickly and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an art in\r\n",
      "lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts.\r\n",
      "This is one of the useful arts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I will try to learn it, said Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his task, that\r\n",
      "is one of the secrets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and\r\n",
      "placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched\r\n",
      "him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and\r\n",
      "busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he\r\n",
      "seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of\r\n",
      "sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's\r\n",
      "robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure\r\n",
      "of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and\r\n",
      "trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in\r\n",
      "tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in\r\n",
      "waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had\r\n",
      "remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his\r\n",
      "very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light\r\n",
      "and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a\r\n",
      "mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than\r\n",
      "was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy,\r\n",
      "greyed with a silver-pointed down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch.\r\n",
      "Stephen, to fill the silence, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I am sure I could not light a fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, glancing\r\n",
      "up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist is the creation\r\n",
      "of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Can you solve that question now? he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Aquinas, answered Stephen, says PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye.\r\n",
      "Will it therefore be beautiful?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose means\r\n",
      "here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also says\r\n",
      "BONUM EST IN QUOD TENDIT APPETITUS. In so far as it satisfies the\r\n",
      "animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell, however, it is an\r\n",
      "evil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--A draught is said to be a help in these matters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step,\r\n",
      "Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale\r\n",
      "loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no\r\n",
      "spark of Ignatius's enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the\r\n",
      "company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of\r\n",
      "secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of\r\n",
      "apostleship. It seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of\r\n",
      "the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy\r\n",
      "in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning\r\n",
      "them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all\r\n",
      "this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and\r\n",
      "little, if at all, the ends he served. SIMILITER ATQUE SENIS BACULUS,\r\n",
      "he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's\r\n",
      "hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather,\r\n",
      "to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--When may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic\r\n",
      "question? he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on an idea once a\r\n",
      "fortnight if I am lucky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the dean. It is\r\n",
      "like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the depths. Many go\r\n",
      "down into the depths and never come up. Only the trained diver can go\r\n",
      "down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure that\r\n",
      "there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must\r\n",
      "be bound by its own laws.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Ha!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one or two\r\n",
      "ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I see. I quite see your point.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have done\r\n",
      "something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or smells I\r\n",
      "shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I shall sell it\r\n",
      "and buy another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for a fancy\r\n",
      "price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his philosophical\r\n",
      "dissertations by. You know Epictetus?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the soul is\r\n",
      "very like a bucketful of water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put an iron\r\n",
      "lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the\r\n",
      "lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that it was in the\r\n",
      "character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp\r\n",
      "next day instead of the iron lamp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A smell of molten tallow came up from the dean's candle butts and fused\r\n",
      "itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket\r\n",
      "and lamp and lamp and bucket. The priest's voice, too, had a hard\r\n",
      "jingling tone. Stephen's mind halted by instinct, checked by the\r\n",
      "strange tone and the imagery and by the priest's face which seemed like\r\n",
      "an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it\r\n",
      "or within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the\r\n",
      "thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of\r\n",
      "God?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Undoubtedly, said the dean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know\r\n",
      "whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or\r\n",
      "according to the tradition of the marketplace. I remember a sentence of\r\n",
      "Newman's in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detained\r\n",
      "in the full company of the saints. The use of the word in the\r\n",
      "marketplace is quite different. I HOPE I AM NOT DETAINING YOU.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not in the least, said the dean politely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, yes; I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point:\r\n",
      "DETAIN.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice\r\n",
      "problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you\r\n",
      "pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can\r\n",
      "hold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What funnel? asked Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What is a tundish?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That. The... funnel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never heard\r\n",
      "the word in my life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen, laughing,\r\n",
      "where they speak the best English.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most interesting\r\n",
      "word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked at the\r\n",
      "English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable\r\n",
      "may have turned on the prodigal. A humble follower in the wake of\r\n",
      "clamorous conversions, a poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have\r\n",
      "entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of\r\n",
      "intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all\r\n",
      "but given through--a late-comer, a tardy spirit. From what had he set\r\n",
      "out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, seeing\r\n",
      "salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the\r\n",
      "establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the\r\n",
      "welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms, six\r\n",
      "principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake baptists, supralapsarian\r\n",
      "dogmatists? Had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up\r\n",
      "to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun line of reasoning upon\r\n",
      "insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy\r\n",
      "Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that\r\n",
      "disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of\r\n",
      "some zinc-roofed chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dean repeated the word yet again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Tundish! Well now, that is interesting!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting.\r\n",
      "What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of\r\n",
      "earth, said Stephen coldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his\r\n",
      "sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt with a\r\n",
      "smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a\r\n",
      "countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How\r\n",
      "different are the words HOME, CHRIST, ALE, MASTER, on his lips and on\r\n",
      "mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His\r\n",
      "language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired\r\n",
      "speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at\r\n",
      "bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, the dean\r\n",
      "added, to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty. And to\r\n",
      "inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts.\r\n",
      "These are some interesting points we might take up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry tone, was\r\n",
      "silent; and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and\r\n",
      "confused voices came up the staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--In pursuing these speculations, said the dean conclusively, there\r\n",
      "is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition. First you must take\r\n",
      "your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. Then, little by\r\n",
      "little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life\r\n",
      "and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan.\r\n",
      "He was a long time before he got to the top. But he got there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say what is in\r\n",
      "us. I most certainly should not be despondent. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the\r\n",
      "arrival of the first arts' class.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and\r\n",
      "impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank\r\n",
      "smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity began to fall like\r\n",
      "dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of\r\n",
      "the knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal\r\n",
      "than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he\r\n",
      "would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and\r\n",
      "his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of\r\n",
      "the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during\r\n",
      "all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the lax\r\n",
      "and the lukewarm and the prudent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of Kentish\r\n",
      "fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier\r\n",
      "of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. The calling of\r\n",
      "the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all\r\n",
      "tones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Here!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by\r\n",
      "coughs of protest along the other benches.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The professor paused in his reading and called the next name:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Cranly!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Mr Cranly!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his friend's\r\n",
      "studies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Try Leopardstown! said a voice from the bench behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the\r\n",
      "grey light, was impassive. A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of\r\n",
      "the notebooks Stephen turned back again and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Give me some paper for God's sake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the\r\n",
      "coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like\r\n",
      "symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded Stephen's mind. He\r\n",
      "had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason. O\r\n",
      "the grey dull day! It seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness\r\n",
      "through which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long\r\n",
      "slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight,\r\n",
      "radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster,\r\n",
      "farther and more impalpable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. Perhaps some\r\n",
      "of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In\r\n",
      "one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to\r\n",
      "play:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    On a cloth untrue\r\n",
      "    With a twisted cue\r\n",
      "    And elliptical billiard balls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal\r\n",
      "axes of which I spoke a moment ago.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister\r\n",
      "of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that\r\n",
      "hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of\r\n",
      "misrule. The forms of the community emerged from the gust-blown\r\n",
      "vestments, the dean of studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap\r\n",
      "of grey hair, the president, the little priest with feathery hair who\r\n",
      "wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form of the professor of\r\n",
      "economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental science\r\n",
      "discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a\r\n",

      "I see in this institution that has an individual mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Institution! Individual! cried Cranly. Go home, blast you, for\r\n",
      "you're a hopeless bloody man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I'm an emotional man, said Temple. That's quite rightly expressed.\r\n",
      "And I'm proud that I'm an emotionalist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sidled out of the alley, smiling slyly. Cranly watched him with a\r\n",
      "blank expressionless face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Look at him! he said. Did you ever see such a go-by-the-wall?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His phrase was greeted by a strange laugh from a student who lounged\r\n",
      "against the wall, his peaked cap down on his eyes. The laugh, pitched\r\n",
      "in a high key and coming from a so muscular frame, seemed like the\r\n",
      "whinny of an elephant. The student's body shook all over and, to ease\r\n",
      "his mirth, he rubbed both his hands delightedly over his groins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Lynch is awake, said Cranly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch, for answer, straightened himself and thrust forward his chest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Lynch puts out his chest, said Stephen, as a criticism of life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch smote himself sonorously on the chest and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Who has anything to say about my girth?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly took him at the word and the two began to tussle. When their\r\n",
      "faces had flushed with the struggle they drew apart, panting. Stephen\r\n",
      "bent down towards Davin who, intent on the game, had paid no heed to\r\n",
      "the talk of the others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And how is my little tame goose? he asked. Did he sign, too?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Davin nodded and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And you, Stevie?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You're a terrible man, Stevie, said Davin, taking the short pipe\r\n",
      "from his mouth, always alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Now that you have signed the petition for universal peace, said\r\n",
      "Stephen, I suppose you will burn that little copybook I saw in your\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Davin did not answer, Stephen began to quote:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Long pace, fianna! Right incline, fianna! Fianna, by numbers,\r\n",
      "salute, one, two!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That's a different question, said Davin. I'm an Irish nationalist,\r\n",
      "first and foremost. But that's you all out. You're a born sneerer,\r\n",
      "Stevie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--When you make the next rebellion with hurleysticks, said Stephen,\r\n",
      "and want the indispensable informer, tell me. I can find you a few in\r\n",
      "this college.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I can't understand you, said Davin. One time I hear you talk against\r\n",
      "English literature. Now you talk against the Irish informers. What with\r\n",
      "your name and your ideas--Are you Irish at all?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Come with me now to the office of arms and I will show you the tree\r\n",
      "of my family, said Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Then be one of us, said Davin. Why don't you learn Irish? Why did you\r\n",
      "drop out of the league class after the first lesson?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You know one reason why, answered Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Davin tossed his head and laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Oh, come now, he said. Is it on account of that certain young lady\r\n",
      "and Father Moran? But that's all in your own mind, Stevie. They were\r\n",
      "only talking and laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen paused and laid a friendly hand upon Davin's shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you remember, he said, when we knew each other first? The first\r\n",
      "morning we met you asked me to show you the way to the matriculation\r\n",
      "class, putting a very strong stress on the first syllable. You\r\n",
      "remember? Then you used to address the jesuits as father, you remember?\r\n",
      "I ask myself about you: IS HE AS INNOCENT AS HIS SPEECH?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you told me\r\n",
      "that night in Harcourt Street those things about your private life,\r\n",
      "honest to God, Stevie, I was not able to eat my dinner. I was quite\r\n",
      "bad. I was awake a long time that night. Why did you tell me those\r\n",
      "things?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Thanks, said Stephen. You mean I am a monster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--No, said Davin. But I wish you had not told me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tide began to surge beneath the calm surface of Stephen's\r\n",
      "friendliness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--This race and this country and this life produced me, he said. I\r\n",
      "shall express myself as I am.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Try to be one of us, repeated Davin. In heart you are an Irish man\r\n",
      "but your pride is too powerful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--My ancestors threw off their language and took another, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "They allowed a handful of foreigners to subject them. Do you fancy I am\r\n",
      "going to pay in my own life and person debts they made? What for?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--For our freedom, said Davin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--No honourable and sincere man, said Stephen, has given up to you his\r\n",
      "life and his youth and his affections from the days of Tone to those of\r\n",
      "Parnell, but you sold him to the enemy or failed him in need or reviled\r\n",
      "him and left him for another. And you invite me to be one of you. I'd\r\n",
      "see you damned first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--They died for their ideals, Stevie, said Davin. Our day will come\r\n",
      "yet, believe me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, following his own thought, was silent for an instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those moments I told you\r\n",
      "of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than the birth of the\r\n",
      "body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets\r\n",
      "flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality,\r\n",
      "language, religion. I shall try to fly by those nets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Davin knocked the ashes from his pipe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Too deep for me, Stevie, he said. But a man's country comes first.\r\n",
      "Ireland first, Stevie. You can be a poet or a mystic after.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with cold violence.\r\n",
      "Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Davin rose from his box and went towards the players, shaking his head\r\n",
      "sadly. But in a moment his sadness left him and he was hotly disputing\r\n",
      "with Cranly and the two players who had finished their game. A match of\r\n",
      "four was arranged, Cranly insisting, however, that his ball should be\r\n",
      "used. He let it rebound twice or thrice to his hand and struck it strongly\r\n",
      "and swiftly towards the base of the alley, exclaiming in answer to its\r\n",
      "thud:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Your soul!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen stood with Lynch till the score began to rise. Then he plucked\r\n",
      "him by the sleeve to come away. Lynch obeyed, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Let us eke go, as Cranly has it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen smiled at this side-thrust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They passed back through the garden and out through the hall where the\r\n",
      "doddering porter was pinning up a hall notice in the frame. At the foot\r\n",
      "of the steps they halted and Stephen took a packet of cigarettes from\r\n",
      "his pocket and offered it to his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I know you are poor, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Damn your yellow insolence, answered Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This second proof of Lynch's culture made Stephen smile again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--It was a great day for European culture, he said, when you made up\r\n",
      "your mind to swear in yellow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They lit their cigarettes and turned to the right. After a pause\r\n",
      "Stephen began:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Aristotle has not defined pity and terror. I have. I say--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch halted and said bluntly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Stop! I won't listen! I am sick. I was out last night on a yellow\r\n",
      "drunk with Horan and Goggins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen went on:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Pity is the feeling which arrests the mind in the presence of\r\n",
      "whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and unites it with\r\n",
      "the human sufferer. Terror is the feeling which arrests the mind in the\r\n",
      "presence of whatsoever is grave and constant in human sufferings and\r\n",
      "unites it with the secret cause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Repeat, said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen repeated the definitions slowly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--A girl got into a hansom a few days ago, he went on, in London. She\r\n",
      "was on her way to meet her mother whom she had not seen for many years.\r\n",
      "At the corner of a street the shaft of a lorry shivered the window of\r\n",
      "the hansom in the shape of a star. A long fine needle of the shivered\r\n",
      "glass pierced her heart. She died on the instant. The reporter called\r\n",
      "it a tragic death. It is not. It is remote from terror and pity\r\n",
      "according to the terms of my definitions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The tragic emotion, in fact, is a face looking two ways, towards\r\n",
      "terror and towards pity, both of which are phases of it. You see I use\r\n",
      "the word ARREST. I mean that the tragic emotion is static. Or rather\r\n",
      "the dramatic emotion is. The feelings excited by improper art are\r\n",
      "kinetic, desire or loathing. Desire urges us to possess, to go to\r\n",
      "something; loathing urges us to abandon, to go from something. The arts\r\n",
      "which excite them, pornographical or didactic, are therefore improper\r\n",
      "arts. The esthetic emotion (I used the general term) is therefore\r\n",
      "static. The mind is arrested and raised above desire and loathing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You say that art must not excite desire, said Lynch. I told you that\r\n",
      "one day I wrote my name in pencil on the backside of the Venus of\r\n",
      "Praxiteles in the Museum. Was that not desire?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I speak of normal natures, said Stephen. You also told me that when\r\n",
      "you were a boy in that charming carmelite school you ate pieces of\r\n",
      "dried cowdung.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch broke again into a whinny of laughter and again rubbed both his\r\n",
      "hands over his groins but without taking them from his pockets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--O, I did! I did! he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen turned towards his companion and looked at him for a moment\r\n",
      "boldly in the eyes. Lynch, recovering from his laughter, answered his\r\n",
      "look from his humbled eyes. The long slender flattened skull beneath\r\n",
      "the long pointed cap brought before Stephen's mind the image of a\r\n",
      "hooded reptile. The eyes, too, were reptile-like in glint and gaze. Yet\r\n",
      "at that instant, humbled and alert in their look, they were lit by one\r\n",
      "tiny human point, the window of a shrivelled soul, poignant and\r\n",
      "self-embittered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--As for that, Stephen said in polite parenthesis, we are all animals.\r\n",
      "I also am an animal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You are, said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But we are just now in a mental world, Stephen continued. The desire\r\n",
      "and loathing excited by improper esthetic means are really not esthetic\r\n",
      "emotions not only because they are kinetic in character but also\r\n",
      "because they are not more than physical. Our flesh shrinks from what it\r\n",
      "dreads and responds to the stimulus of what it desires by a purely\r\n",
      "reflex action of the nervous system. Our eyelid closes before we are\r\n",
      "aware that the fly is about to enter our eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not always, said Lynch critically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--In the same way, said Stephen, your flesh responded to the stimulus\r\n",
      "of a naked statue, but it was, I say, simply a reflex action of the\r\n",
      "nerves. Beauty expressed by the artist cannot awaken in us an emotion\r\n",
      "which is kinetic or a sensation which is purely physical. It awakens,\r\n",
      "or ought to awaken, or induces, or ought to induce, an esthetic stasis,\r\n",
      "an ideal pity or an ideal terror, a stasis called forth, prolonged, and\r\n",
      "at last dissolved by what I call the rhythm of beauty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What is that exactly? asked Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Rhythm, said Stephen, is the first formal esthetic relation of part\r\n",
      "to part in any esthetic whole or of an esthetic whole to its part or\r\n",
      "parts or of any part to the esthetic whole of which it is a part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--If that is rhythm, said Lynch, let me hear what you call beauty;\r\n",
      "and, please remember, though I did eat a cake of cowdung once, that I\r\n",
      "admire only beauty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen raised his cap as if in greeting. Then, blushing slightly, he\r\n",
      "laid his hand on Lynch's thick tweed sleeve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--We are right, he said, and the others are wrong. To speak of these\r\n",
      "things and to try to understand their nature and, having understood it,\r\n",
      "to try slowly and humbly and constantly to express, to press out again,\r\n",
      "from the gross earth or what it brings forth, from sound and shape and\r\n",
      "colour which are the prison gates of our soul, an image of the beauty\r\n",
      "we have come to understand--that is art.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went\r\n",
      "on by the trees. A crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and\r\n",
      "a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the\r\n",
      "course of Stephen's thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But you have not answered my question, said Lynch. What is art? What\r\n",
      "is the beauty it expresses?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That was the first definition I gave you, you sleepy-headed wretch,\r\n",
      "said Stephen, when I began to try to think out the matter for myself.\r\n",
      "Do you remember the night? Cranly lost his temper and began to talk\r\n",
      "about Wicklow bacon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I remember, said Lynch. He told us about them flaming fat devils of\r\n",
      "pigs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Art, said Stephen, is the human disposition of sensible or\r\n",
      "intelligible matter for an esthetic end. You remember the pigs and\r\n",
      "forget that. You are a distressing pair, you and Cranly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch made a grimace at the raw grey sky and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--If I am to listen to your esthetic philosophy give me at least\r\n",
      "another cigarette. I don't care about it. I don't even care about\r\n",
      "women. Damn you and damn everything. I want a job of five hundred a\r\n",
      "year. You can't get me one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen handed him the packet of cigarettes. Lynch took the last one\r\n",
      "that remained, saying simply:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Proceed!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Aquinas, said Stephen, says that is beautiful the apprehension of\r\n",
      "which pleases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I remember that, he said, PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--He uses the word VISA, said Stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions of\r\n",
      "all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of\r\n",
      "apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is clear enough to keep\r\n",
      "away good and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly\r\n",
      "a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a\r\n",
      "stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the\r\n",
      "hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--No, said Lynch, give me the hypotenuse of the Venus of Praxiteles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Static therefore, said Stephen. Plato, I believe, said that beauty\r\n",
      "is the splendour of truth. I don't think that it has a meaning, but the\r\n",
      "true and the beautiful are akin. Truth is beheld by the intellect which\r\n",
      "is appeased by the most satisfying relations of the intelligible;\r\n",
      "beauty is beheld by the imagination which is appeased by the most\r\n",
      "satisfying relations of the sensible. The first step in the direction\r\n",
      "of truth is to understand the frame and scope of the intellect itself,\r\n",
      "to comprehend the act itself of intellection. Aristotle's entire system\r\n",
      "of philosophy rests upon his book of psychology and that, I think,\r\n",
      "rests on his statement that the same attribute cannot at the same time\r\n",
      "and in the same connexion belong to and not belong to the same subject.\r\n",
      "The first step in the direction of beauty is to understand the frame\r\n",
      "and scope of the imagination, to comprehend the act itself of esthetic\r\n",
      "apprehension. Is that clear?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But what is beauty? asked Lynch impatiently. Out with another\r\n",
      "definition. Something we see and like! Is that the best you and Aquinas\r\n",
      "can do?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Let us take woman, said Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Let us take her! said Lynch fervently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said\r\n",
      "Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That seems\r\n",
      "to be a maze out of which we cannot escape. I see, however,\r\n",
      "two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality\r\n",
      "admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold\r\n",
      "functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so.\r\n",
      "The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my\r\n",
      "part I dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to\r\n",
      "esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room\r\n",
      "where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand\r\n",
      "on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of\r\n",
      "Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and\r\n",
      "admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give good\r\n",
      "milk to her children and yours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Then MacCann is a sulphur-yellow liar, said Lynch energetically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--There remains another way out, said Stephen, laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--To wit? said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--This hypothesis, Stephen began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long dray laden with old iron came round the corner of Sir Patrick\r\n",
      "Dun's hospital covering the end of Stephen's speech with the harsh roar\r\n",
      "of jangled and rattling metal. Lynch closed his ears and gave out oath\r\n",
      "after oath till the dray had passed. Then he turned on his heel rudely.\r\n",
      "Stephen turned also and waited for a few moments till his companion's\r\n",
      "ill-humour had had its vent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--This hypothesis, Stephen repeated, is the other way out: that,\r\n",
      "though the same object may not seem beautiful to all people, all people\r\n",
      "who admire a beautiful object find in it certain relations which\r\n",
      "satisfy and coincide with the stages themselves of all esthetic\r\n",
      "apprehension. These relations of the sensible, visible to you through\r\n",
      "one form and to me through another, must be therefore the necessary\r\n",
      "qualities of beauty. Now, we can return to our old friend saint Thomas\r\n",
      "for another pennyworth of wisdom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--It amuses me vastly, he said, to hear you quoting him time after\r\n",
      "time like a jolly round friar. Are you laughing in your sleeve?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--MacAlister, answered Stephen, would call my esthetic theory applied\r\n",
      "Aquinas. So far as this side of esthetic philosophy extends, Aquinas\r\n",
      "will carry me all along the line. When we come to the phenomena of\r\n",
      "artistic conception, artistic gestation, and artistic reproduction I\r\n",
      "require a new terminology and a new personal experience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his intellect,\r\n",
      "was exactly a good round friar. But you will tell me about the new\r\n",
      "personal experience and new terminology some other day. Hurry up and\r\n",
      "finish the first part.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Who knows? said Stephen, smiling. Perhaps Aquinas would understand\r\n",
      "me better than you. He was a poet himself. He wrote a hymn for Maundy\r\n",
      "Thursday. It begins with the words PANGE LINGUA GLORIOSI. They say it\r\n",
      "is the highest glory of the hymnal. It is an intricate and soothing\r\n",
      "hymn. I like it; but there is no hymn that can be put beside that\r\n",
      "mournful and majestic processional song, the VEXILLA REGIS of Venantius\r\n",
      "Fortunatus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch began to sing softly and solemnly in a deep bass voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    IMPLETA SUNT QUAE CONCINIT\r\n",
      "    DAVID FIDELI CARMINE\r\n",
      "    DICENDO NATIONIBUS\r\n",
      "    REGNAVIT A LIGNO DEUS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That's great! he said, well pleased. Great music!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned into Lower Mount Street. A few steps from the corner a fat\r\n",
      "young man, wearing a silk neckcloth, saluted them and stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was\r\n",
      "plucked. Halpin and O'Flynn are through the home civil. Moonan got\r\n",
      "fifth place in the Indian. O'Shaughnessy got fourteenth. The Irish\r\n",
      "fellows in Clark's gave them a feed last night. They all ate curry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His pallid bloated face expressed benevolent malice and, as he had\r\n",
      "advanced through his tidings of success, his small fat-encircled eyes\r\n",
      "vanished out of sight and his weak wheezing voice out of hearing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In reply to a question of Stephen's his eyes and his voice came forth\r\n",
      "again from their lurking-places.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, MacCullagh and I, he said. He's taking pure mathematics and I'm\r\n",
      "taking constitutional history. There are twenty subjects. I'm taking\r\n",
      "botany too. You know I'm a member of the field club.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew back from the other two in a stately fashion and placed a plump\r\n",
      "woollen-gloved hand on his breast from which muttered wheezing laughter\r\n",
      "at once broke forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Bring us a few turnips and onions the next time you go out, said\r\n",
      "Stephen drily, to make a stew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fat student laughed indulgently and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--We are all highly respectable people in the field club. Last\r\n",
      "Saturday we went out to Glenmalure, seven of us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--With women, Donovan? said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Donovan again laid his hand on his chest and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Our end is the acquisition of knowledge. Then he said quickly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I hear you are writing some essays about esthetics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen made a vague gesture of denial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Goethe and Lessing, said Donovan, have written a lot on that\r\n",
      "subject, the classical school and the romantic school and all that. The\r\n",
      "Laocoon interested me very much when I read it. Of course it is\r\n",
      "idealistic, German, ultra-profound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Neither of the others spoke. Donovan took leave of them urbanely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I must go, he said softly and benevolently, I have a strong\r\n",
      "suspicion, amounting almost to a conviction, that my sister intended to\r\n",
      "make pancakes today for the dinner of the Donovan family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Goodbye, Stephen said in his wake. Don't forget the turnips for me\r\n",
      "and my mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lynch gazed after him, his lip curling in slow scorn till his face\r\n",
      "resembled a devil's mask:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--To think that that yellow pancake-eating excrement can get a good\r\n",
      "job, he said at length, and I have to smoke cheap cigarettes!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned their faces towards Merrion Square and went for a little in\r\n",
      "silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--To finish what I was saying about beauty, said Stephen, the most\r\n",
      "satisfying relations of the sensible must therefore correspond to the\r\n",
      "necessary phases of artistic apprehension. Find these and you find the\r\n",
      "qualities of universal beauty. Aquinas says: AD PULCRITUDINEM TRIA\r\n",
      "REQUIRUNTUR INTEGRITAS, CONSONANTIA, CLARITAS. I translate it so: THREE\r\n",
      "THINGS ARE NEEDED FOR BEAUTY, WHOLENESS, HARMONY, AND RADIANCE. Do\r\n",
      "these correspond to the phases of apprehension? Are you following?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Of course, I am, said Lynch. If you think I have an excrementitious\r\n",
      "intelligence run after Donovan and ask him to listen to you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen pointed to a basket which a butcher's boy had slung inverted on\r\n",
      "his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Look at that basket, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I see it, said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--In order to see that basket, said Stephen, your mind first of all\r\n",
      "separates the basket from the rest of the visible universe which is not\r\n",
      "the basket. The first phase of apprehension is a bounding line drawn\r\n",
      "about the object to be apprehended. An esthetic image is presented to\r\n",
      "us either in space or in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What is audible is presented in time, what is visible is presented in\r\n",
      "space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is first luminously\r\n",
      "apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the immeasurable\r\n",
      "background of space or time which is not it. You apprehended it as ONE\r\n",
      "thing. You see it as one whole. You apprehend its wholeness. That is\r\n",
      "INTEGRITAS.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Bull's eye! said Lynch, laughing. Go on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Then, said Stephen, you pass from point to point, led by its formal\r\n",
      "lines; you apprehend it as balanced part against part within its\r\n",
      "limits; you feel the rhythm of its structure. In other words, the\r\n",
      "synthesis of immediate perception is followed by the analysis of\r\n",
      "apprehension. Having first felt that it is ONE thing you feel now that\r\n",
      "it is a THING. You apprehend it as complex, multiple, divisible,\r\n",
      "separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and their sum,\r\n",
      "harmonious. That is CONSONANTIA.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Bull's eye again! said Lynch wittily. Tell me now what is CLARITAS\r\n",
      "and you win the cigar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. Aquinas\r\n",
      "uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time.\r\n",
      "It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism,\r\n",
      "the supreme quality of beauty being a light from some other world, the\r\n",
      "idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is\r\n",
      "but the symbol. I thought he might mean that CLARITAS is the artistic\r\n",
      "discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a\r\n",
      "force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a\r\n",
      "universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is\r\n",
      "literary talk. I understand it so. When you have apprehended that\r\n",
      "basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and\r\n",
      "apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is\r\n",
      "logically and esthetically permissible. You see that it is that thing\r\n",
      "which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the\r\n",
      "scholastic QUIDDITAS, the WHATNESS of a thing. This supreme quality is\r\n",
      "felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his\r\n",
      "imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened\r\n",
      "beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality\r\n",
      "of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended\r\n",
      "luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and\r\n",
      "fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic\r\n",
      "pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which\r\n",
      "the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as\r\n",
      "beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen paused and, though his companion did not speak, felt that his\r\n",
      "words had called up around them a thought-enchanted silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What I have said, he began again, refers to beauty in the wider\r\n",
      "sense of the word, in the sense which the word has in the literary\r\n",
      "tradition. In the marketplace it has another sense. When we speak of\r\n",
      "beauty in the second sense of the term our judgement is influenced in\r\n",
      "the first place by the art itself and by the form of that art. The\r\n",
      "image, it is clear, must be set between the mind or senses of the\r\n",
      "artist himself and the mind or senses of others. If you bear this in\r\n",
      "memory you will see that art necessarily divides itself into three\r\n",
      "forms progressing from one to the next. These forms are: the lyrical\r\n",
      "form, the form wherein the artist presents his image in immediate\r\n",
      "relation to himself; the epical form, the form wherein he presents his\r\n",
      "image in mediate relation to himself and to others; the dramatic form,\r\n",
      "the form wherein he presents his image in immediate relation to others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That you told me a few nights ago, said Lynch, and we began the\r\n",
      "famous discussion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I have a book at home, said Stephen, in which I have written down\r\n",
      "questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the\r\n",
      "answers to them I found the theory of esthetic which I am trying to\r\n",
      "explain. Here are some questions I set myself: IS A CHAIR FINELY MADE\r\n",
      "TRAGIC OR COMIC? IS THE PORTRAIT OF MONA LISA GOOD IF I DESIRE TO SEE\r\n",
      "IT? IF NOT, WHY NOT?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Why not, indeed? said Lynch, laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--IF A MAN HACKING IN FURY AT A BLOCK OF WOOD, Stephen continued, MAKE\r\n",
      "THERE AN IMAGE OF A COW, IS THAT IMAGE A WORK OF ART? IF NOT, WHY NOT?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That's a lovely one, said Lynch, laughing again. That has the true\r\n",
      "scholastic stink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to\r\n",
      "write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the forms I spoke\r\n",
      "of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature, the\r\n",
      "highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The\r\n",
      "lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of\r\n",
      "emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled\r\n",
      "at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is more\r\n",
      "conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion.\r\n",
      "The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature\r\n",
      "when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an\r\n",
      "epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional\r\n",
      "gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others. The\r\n",
      "narrative is no longer purely personal. The personality of the artist\r\n",
      "passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons\r\n",
      "and the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see easily in\r\n",
      "that old English ballad TURPIN HERO which begins in the first person\r\n",
      "and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached when the\r\n",
      "vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every\r\n",
      "person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and\r\n",
      "intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist, at first a cry\r\n",
      "or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally\r\n",
      "refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak.\r\n",
      "The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and\r\n",
      "reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic, like\r\n",
      "that of material creation, is accomplished. The artist, like the God of\r\n",
      "creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork,\r\n",
      "invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his\r\n",
      "fingernails.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Trying to refine them also out of existence, said Lynch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fine rain began to fall from the high veiled sky and they turned into\r\n",
      "the duke's lawn to reach the national library before the shower came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What do you mean, Lynch asked surlily, by prating about beauty and\r\n",
      "the imagination in this miserable Godforsaken island? No wonder the\r\n",
      "artist retired within or behind his handiwork after having perpetrated\r\n",
      "this country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rain fell faster. When they passed through the passage beside\r\n",
      "Kildare house they found many students sheltering under the arcade of\r\n",
      "the library. Cranly, leaning against a pillar, was picking his teeth\r\n",
      "with a sharpened match, listening to some companions. Some girls stood\r\n",
      "near the entrance door. Lynch whispered to Stephen:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Your beloved is here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen took his place silently on the step below the group of\r\n",
      "students, heedless of the rain which fell fast, turning his eyes\r\n",
      "towards her from time to time. She too stood silently among her\r\n",
      "companions. She has no priest to flirt with, he thought with conscious\r\n",
      "bitterness, remembering how he had seen her last. Lynch was right. His\r\n",
      "mind emptied of theory and courage, lapsed back into a listless peace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard the students talking among themselves. They spoke of two\r\n",
      "friends who had passed the final medical examination, of the chances of\r\n",
      "getting places on ocean liners, of poor and rich practices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "than in a rich city like that? I know a fellow...\r\n",

      "--Hynes has no brains. He got through by stewing, pure stewing.\r\n",

      "without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck. A grey woollen\r\n",
      "cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her\r\n",
      "fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and\r\n",
      "tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The\r\n",
      "brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand\r\n",
      "freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "back on the nape of his neck and picking his teeth with care.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And here's the wiseacre, said Temple. Do you know that about the\r\n",
      "Forsters?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused for an answer. Cranly dislodged a figseed from his teeth on\r\n",
      "the point of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The Forster family, Temple said, is descended from Baldwin the\r\n",
      "First, king of Flanders. He was called the Forester. Forester and\r\n",

      "--Where did you pick up all that history? O'Keeffe asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I know all the history of your family, too, Temple said, turning to\r\n",
      "Stephen. Do you know what Giraldus Cambrensis says about your family?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive student\r\n",
      "with dark eyes.\r\n",

      "--PERNOBILIS ET PERVETUSTA FAMILIA, Temple said to Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stout student who stood below them on the steps farted briefly. Dixon\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--Did an angel speak?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly turned also and said vehemently but without anger:\r\n",

      "--Goggins, you're the flamingest dirty devil I ever met, do you know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I had it on my mind to say that, Goggins answered firmly. It did no\r\n",
      "one any harm, did it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--We hope, Dixon said suavely, that it was not of the kind known to\r\n",
      "science as a PAULO POST FUTURUM.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Didn't I tell you he was a smiler? said Temple, turning right and\r\n",
      "left. Didn't I give him that name?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You did. We're not deaf, said the tall consumptive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly still frowned at the stout student below him. Then, with a snort\r\n",
      "of disgust, he shoved him violently down the steps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Go away from here, he said rudely. Go away, you stinkpot. And you are a\r\n",
      "stinkpot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place\r\n",
      "with good humour. Temple turned back to Stephen and asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you believe in the law of heredity?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Are you drunk or what are you or what are you trying to say? asked\r\n",
      "Cranly, facing round on him with an expression of wonder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The most profound sentence ever written, Temple said with\r\n",
      "enthusiasm, is the sentence at the end of the zoology. Reproduction is\r\n",
      "the beginning of death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He touched Stephen timidly at the elbow and said eagerly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you feel how profound that is because you are a poet?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly pointed his long forefinger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Look at him! he said with scorn to the others. Look at Ireland's hope!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They laughed at his words and gesture. Temple turned on him bravely,\r\n",
      "saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Cranly, you're always sneering at me. I can see that. But I am as\r\n",
      "good as you any day. Do you know what I think about you now as compared\r\n",
      "with myself?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--My dear man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do you know,\r\n",
      "absolutely incapable of thinking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But do you know, Temple went on, what I think of you and of myself\r\n",
      "compared together?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Out with it, Temple! the stout student cried from the steps. Get it\r\n",
      "out in bits!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Temple turned right and left, making sudden feeble gestures as he spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I'm a ballocks, he said, shaking his head in despair. I am and I\r\n",
      "know I am. And I admit it that I am.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dixon patted him lightly on the shoulder and said mildly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And it does you every credit, Temple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But he, Temple said, pointing to Cranly, he is a ballocks, too, like\r\n",
      "me. Only he doesn't know it. And that's the only difference I see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A burst of laughter covered his words. But he turned again to Stephen\r\n",
      "and said with a sudden eagerness:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That word is a most interesting word. That's the only English dual\r\n",
      "number. Did you know?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Is it? Stephen said vaguely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was watching Cranly's firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a\r\n",
      "smile of false patience. The gross name had passed over it like foul\r\n",
      "water poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he\r\n",
      "watched him, he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the black\r\n",
      "hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephen\r\n",
      "in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there not a slight flush on\r\n",
      "Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at Temple's words? The light had\r\n",
      "waned. He could not see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Did that explain his friend's listless silence, his harsh comments, the\r\n",
      "sudden intrusions of rude speech with which he had shattered so often\r\n",
      "Stephen's ardent wayward confessions? Stephen had forgiven freely for\r\n",
      "he had found this rudeness also in himself. And he remembered an\r\n",
      "evening when he had dismounted from a borrowed creaking bicycle to pray\r\n",
      "to God in a wood near Malahide. He had lifted up his arms and spoken in\r\n",
      "ecstasy to the sombre nave of the trees, knowing that he stood on holy\r\n",
      "ground and in a holy hour. And when two constabulary men had come into\r\n",
      "sight round a bend in the gloomy road he had broken off his prayer to\r\n",
      "whistle loudly an air from the last pantomime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a\r\n",
      "pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. The talk about him\r\n",
      "ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. But\r\n",
      "no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had\r\n",
      "followed with idle eyes were sleeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save\r\n",
      "for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had\r\n",
      "ceased their babble. Darkness was falling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    Darkness falls from the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host\r\n",
      "around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening air or the verse\r\n",
      "with its black vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked away slowly towards the deeper shadows at the end of the\r\n",
      "colonnade, beating the stone softly with his stick to hide his revery\r\n",
      "from the students whom he had left: and allowed his mind to summon back\r\n",
      "to itself the age of Dowland and Byrd and Nash.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the\r\n",
      "breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of\r\n",
      "chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that\r\n",
      "mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted\r\n",
      "in the language of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs,\r\n",
      "the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in\r\n",
      "Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the\r\n",
      "pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding\r\n",
      "to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The images he had summoned gave him no pleasure. They were secret and\r\n",
      "inflaming but her image was not entangled by them. That was not the way\r\n",
      "to think of her. It was not even the way in which he thought of her.\r\n",
      "Could his mind then not trust itself? Old phrases, sweet only with a\r\n",
      "disinterred sweetness like the figseeds Cranly rooted out of his\r\n",
      "gleaming teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not thought nor vision though he knew vaguely that her figure\r\n",
      "was passing homeward through the city. Vaguely first and then more\r\n",
      "sharply he smelt her body. A conscious unrest seethed in his blood.\r\n",
      "Yes, it was her body he smelt, a wild and languid smell, the tepid\r\n",
      "limbs over which his music had flowed desirously and the secret soft\r\n",
      "linen upon which her flesh distilled odour and a dew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and\r\n",
      "forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its\r\n",
      "body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger\r\n",
      "for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it\r\n",
      "live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUS A\r\n",
      "LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by\r\n",
      "God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the\r\n",
      "skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill\r\n",
      "clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden\r\n",
      "spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies\r\n",
      "of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and\r\n",
      "it was not darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    Brightness falls from the air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the images it had\r\n",
      "awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born\r\n",
      "of the sweat of sloth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students.\r\n",
      "Well then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean\r\n",
      "athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black\r\n",
      "hair on his chest. Let her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly had taken another dried fig from the supply in his pocket and\r\n",

      "young man came out of the porch, a leather portfolio tucked under his\r\n",
      "armpit. He marched towards the group, striking the flags with the heels\r\n",
      "of his boots and with the ferrule of his heavy umbrella. Then, raising\r\n",
      "the umbrella in salute, he said to all:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Good evening, sirs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "slight nervous movement. The tall consumptive student and Dixon and\r\n",
      "O'Keeffe were speaking in Irish and did not answer him. Then, turning\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--Good evening, particularly to you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved the umbrella in indication and tittered again. Cranly, who was\r\n",
      "still chewing the fig, answered with loud movements of his jaws.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Good? Yes. It is a good evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The squat student looked at him seriously and shook his umbrella gently\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--I can see, he said, that you are about to make obvious remarks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Um, Cranly answered, holding out what remained of the half chewed\r\n",
      "fig and jerking it towards the squat student's mouth in sign that he\r\n",
      "should eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--Do you intend that...?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He broke off, pointed bluntly to the munched pulp of the fig, and said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--I allude to that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--That phrase you said now, he said, is from the new testament about\r\n",
      "suffer the children to come to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Go to sleep again, Temple, said O'Keeffe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Very well, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, and if\r\n",
      "Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all\r\n",
      "to hell if they die unbaptized? Why is that?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Were you baptized yourself, Temple? the consumptive student asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But why are they sent to hell if Jesus said they were all to come?\r\n",
      "Temple said, his eyes searching Glynn's eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glynn coughed and said gently, holding back with difficulty the nervous\r\n",
      "titter in his voice and moving his umbrella at every word:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And, as you remark, if it is thus, I ask emphatically whence comes\r\n",
      "this thusness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Because the church is cruel like all old sinners, Temple said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Are you quite orthodox on that point, Temple? Dixon said suavely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Saint Augustine says that about unbaptized children going to hell,\r\n",
      "Temple answered, because he was a cruel old sinner too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I bow to you, Dixon said, but I had the impression that limbo\r\n",
      "existed for such cases.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Don't argue with him, Dixon, Cranly said brutally. Don't talk to him\r\n",
      "or look at him. Lead him home with a sugan the way you'd lead a\r\n",
      "bleating goat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Limbo! Temple cried. That's a fine invention too. Like hell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But with the unpleasantness left out, Dixon said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned smiling to the others and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I think I am voicing the opinions of all present in saying so much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You are, Glynn said in a firm tone. On that point Ireland is united.\r\n",

      "He struck the ferrule of his umbrella on the stone floor of the\r\n",
      "colonnade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Hell, Temple said. I can respect that invention of the grey spouse\r\n",
      "of Satan. Hell is Roman, like the walls of the Romans, strong and ugly.\r\n",
      "But what is limbo?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Put him back into the perambulator, Cranly, O'Keeffe called out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly made a swift step towards Temple, halted, stamping his foot,\r\n",
      "crying as if to a fowl:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Hoosh!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Temple moved away nimbly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you know what limbo is? he cried. Do you know what we call a\r\n",
      "notion like that in Roscommon?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Hoosh! Blast you! Cranly cried, clapping his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Neither my arse nor my elbow! Temple cried out scornfully. And\r\n",
      "that's what I call limbo.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Give us that stick here, Cranly said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He snatched the ashplant roughly from Stephen's hand and sprang down\r\n",
      "the steps: but Temple, hearing him move in pursuit, fled through the\r\n",
      "dusk like a wild creature, nimble and fleet-footed. Cranly's heavy\r\n",
      "boots were heard loudly charging across the quadrangle and then\r\n",
      "returning heavily, foiled and spurning the gravel at each step.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His step was angry and with an angry abrupt gesture he thrust the stick\r\n",
      "back into Stephen's hand. Stephen felt that his anger had another cause\r\n",
      "but, feigning patience, touched his arm slightly and said quietly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Cranly, I told you I wanted to speak to you. Come away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly looked at him for a few moments and asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Now?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, now, Stephen said. We can't speak here. Come away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They crossed the quadrangle together without speaking. The bird call\r\n",
      "from SIEGFRIED whistled softly followed them from the steps of the\r\n",
      "porch. Cranly turned, and Dixon, who had whistled, called out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Where are you fellows off to? What about that game, Cranly?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They parleyed in shouts across the still air about a game of billiards\r\n",
      "to be played in the Adelphi hotel. Stephen walked on alone and out into\r\n",
      "the quiet of Kildare Street opposite Maple's hotel he stood to wait,\r\n",
      "patient again. The name of the hotel, a colourless polished wood, and\r\n",
      "its colourless front stung him like a glance of polite disdain. He\r\n",
      "stared angrily back at the softly lit drawing-room of the hotel in\r\n",
      "which he imagined the sleek lives of the patricians of Ireland housed\r\n",
      "in calm. They thought of army commissions and land agents: peasants\r\n",
      "greeted them along the roads in the country; they knew the names of\r\n",
      "certain French dishes and gave orders to jarvies in high-pitched\r\n",
      "provincial voices which pierced through their skin-tight accents.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the\r\n",
      "imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them,\r\n",
      "that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the\r\n",
      "deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he\r\n",
      "belonged flitting like bats across the dark country lanes, under trees\r\n",
      "by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs. A woman had\r\n",
      "waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at night and, offering him\r\n",
      "a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for Davin had the mild\r\n",
      "eyes of one who could be secret. But him no woman's eyes had wooed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His arm was taken in a strong grip and Cranly's voice said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Let us eke go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked southward in silence. Then Cranly said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That blithering idiot, Temple! I swear to Moses, do you know, that\r\n",
      "I'll be the death of that fellow one time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his voice was no longer angry and Stephen wondered was he thinking\r\n",
      "of her greeting to him under the porch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They turned to the left and walked on as before. When they had gone on\r\n",
      "so for some time Stephen said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Cranly, I had an unpleasant quarrel this evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--With your people? Cranly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--With my mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--About religion?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a pause Cranly asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What age is your mother?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not old, Stephen said. She wishes me to make my easter duty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And will you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I will not, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Why not? Cranly said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I will not serve, answered Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That remark was made before, Cranly said calmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--It is made behind now, said Stephen hotly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly pressed Stephen's arm, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Go easy, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do you know.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed nervously as he spoke and, looking up into Stephen's face\r\n",
      "with moved and friendly eyes, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you know that you are an excitable man?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I daresay I am, said Stephen, laughing also.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their minds, lately estranged, seemed suddenly to have been drawn\r\n",
      "closer, one to the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you believe in the eucharist? Cranly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I do not, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you disbelieve then?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I neither believe in it nor disbelieve in it, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Many persons have doubts, even religious persons, yet they overcome\r\n",
      "them or put them aside, Cranly said. Are your doubts on that point too\r\n",
      "strong?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I do not wish to overcome them, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly, embarrassed for a moment, took another fig from his pocket and\r\n",
      "was about to eat it when Stephen said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your mouth full\r\n",
      "of chewed fig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly examined the fig by the light of a lamp under which he halted.\r\n",
      "Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and\r\n",
      "threw the fig rudely into the gutter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Addressing it as it lay, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Taking Stephen's arm, he went on again and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you not fear that those words may be spoken to you on the day of\r\n",
      "Judgement?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What is offered me on the other hand? Stephen asked. An eternity of\r\n",
      "bliss in the company of the dean of studies?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Remember, Cranly said, that he would be glorified.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Ay, Stephen said somewhat bitterly, bright, agile, impassible and,\r\n",
      "above all, subtle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--It is a curious thing, do you know, Cranly said dispassionately, how\r\n",
      "your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you\r\n",
      "disbelieve. Did you believe in it when you were at school? I bet you\r\n",
      "did.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I did, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly, happier than you are\r\n",
      "now, for instance?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was someone else\r\n",
      "then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--How someone else? What do you mean by that statement?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I had to\r\n",
      "become.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Not as you are now, not as you had to become, Cranly repeated. Let\r\n",
      "me ask you a question. Do you love your mother?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen shook his head slowly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I don't know what your words mean, he said simply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Have you never loved anyone? Cranly asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you mean women?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a colder tone. I ask you\r\n",
      "if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen walked on beside his friend, staring gloomily at the footpath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I tried to love God, he said at length. It seems now I failed. It is\r\n",
      "very difficult. I tried to unite my will with the will of God instant\r\n",
      "by instant. In that I did not always fail. I could perhaps do that\r\n",
      "still--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly cut him short by asking:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Has your mother had a happy life?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--How do I know? Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--How many children had she?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Nine or ten, Stephen answered. Some died.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Was your father... Cranly interrupted himself for an instant, and then\r\n",
      "said: I don't want to pry into your family affairs. But was your father\r\n",
      "what is called well-to-do? I mean, when you were growing up?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--What was he? Cranly asked after a pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen began to enumerate glibly his father's attributes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a shouting\r\n",
      "politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a drinker, a good\r\n",
      "fellow, a story-teller, somebody's secretary, something in a\r\n",
      "distillery, a tax-gatherer, a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his\r\n",
      "own past.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly laughed, tightening his grip on Stephen's arm, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The distillery is damn good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Is there anything else you want to know? Stephen asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Are you in good circumstances at present?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do I look it? Stephen asked bluntly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--So then, Cranly went on musingly, you were born in the lap of luxury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He used the phrase broadly and loudly as he often used technical\r\n",
      "expressions, as if he wished his hearer to understand that they were\r\n",
      "used by him without conviction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Your mother must have gone through a good deal of suffering, he said\r\n",
      "then. Would you not try to save her from suffering more even if... or would\r\n",
      "you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--If I could, Stephen said, that would cost me very little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Then do so, Cranly said. Do as she wishes you to do. What is it for\r\n",
      "you? You disbelieve in it. It is a form: nothing else. And you will set\r\n",
      "her mind at rest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. Then, as if\r\n",
      "giving utterance to the process of his own thought, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Whatever else is unsure in this stinking dunghill of a world a\r\n",
      "mother's love is not. Your mother brings you into the world, carries\r\n",
      "you first in her body. What do we know about what she feels? But\r\n",
      "whatever she feels, it, at least, must be real. It must be. What are\r\n",
      "our ideas or ambitions? Play. Ideas! Why, that bloody bleating goat\r\n",
      "Temple has ideas. MacCann has ideas too. Every jackass going the roads\r\n",
      "thinks he has ideas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the\r\n",
      "words, said with assumed carelessness:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Pascal, if I remember rightly, would not suffer his mother to kiss\r\n",
      "him as he feared the contact of her sex.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Aloysius Gonzaga, I think, was of the same mind, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And he was another pig then, said Cranly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The church calls him a saint, Stephen objected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I don't care a flaming damn what anyone calls him, Cranly said rudely\r\n",
      "and flatly. I call him a pig.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, preparing the words neatly in his mind, continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Jesus, too, seems to have treated his mother with scant courtesy in\r\n",
      "public but Suarez, a jesuit theologian and Spanish gentleman, has\r\n",
      "apologized for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Did the idea ever occur to you, Cranly asked, that Jesus was not\r\n",
      "what he pretended to be?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The first person to whom that idea occurred, Stephen answered, was\r\n",
      "Jesus himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I mean, Cranly said, hardening in his speech, did the idea ever\r\n",
      "occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite, what he called\r\n",
      "the jews of his time, a whited sepulchre? Or, to put it more plainly,\r\n",
      "that he was a blackguard?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--That idea never occurred to me, Stephen answered. But I am curious\r\n",
      "to know are you trying to make a convert of me or a pervert of\r\n",
      "yourself?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned towards his friend's face and saw there a raw smile which\r\n",
      "some force of will strove to make finely significant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly asked suddenly in a plain sensible tone:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Tell me the truth. Were you at all shocked by what I said?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Somewhat, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And why were you shocked, Cranly pressed on in the same tone, if you\r\n",
      "feel sure that our religion is false and that Jesus was not the son of\r\n",
      "God?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I am not at all sure of it, Stephen said. He is more like a son of\r\n",
      "God than a son of Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--And is that why you will not communicate, Cranly asked, because you\r\n",
      "are not sure of that too, because you feel that the host, too, may be\r\n",
      "the body and blood of the son of God and not a wafer of bread? And\r\n",
      "because you fear that it may be?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, Stephen said quietly, I feel that and I also fear it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I see, Cranly said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, struck by his tone of closure, reopened the discussion at once\r\n",
      "by saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I fear many things: dogs, horses, fire-arms, the sea,\r\n",
      "thunder-storms, machinery, the country roads at night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--But why do you fear a bit of bread?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I imagine, Stephen said, that there is a malevolent reality behind\r\n",
      "those things I say I fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Do you fear then, Cranly asked, that the God of the Roman catholics\r\n",
      "would strike you dead and damn you if you made a sacrilegious\r\n",
      "communion?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--The God of the Roman catholics could do that now, Stephen said. I fear\r\n",
      "more than that the chemical action which would be set up in my soul by\r\n",
      "a false homage to a symbol behind which are massed twenty centuries of\r\n",
      "authority and veneration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Would you, Cranly asked, in extreme danger, commit that particular\r\n",
      "sacrilege? For instance, if you lived in the penal days?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--I cannot answer for the past, Stephen replied. Possibly not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "--And if you got nothing, would you rob?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--You wish me to say, Stephen answered, that the rights of property\r\n",
      "are provisional, and that in certain circumstances it is not unlawful\r\n",
      "to rob. Everyone would act in that belief. So I will not make you that\r\n",
      "answer. Apply to the jesuit theologian, Juan Mariana de Talavera, who\r\n",
      "will also explain to you in what circumstances you may lawfully kill\r\n",
      "your king and whether you had better hand him his poison in a goblet or\r\n",
      "smear it for him upon his robe or his saddlebow. Ask me rather would I\r\n",

      "brood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Look here, Cranly, he said. You have asked me what I would do and\r\n",
      "what I would not do. I will tell you what I will do and what I will not\r\n",
      "do. I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call\r\n",
      "itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express\r\n",
      "myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as\r\n",

      "exile, and cunning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Cranly seized his arm and steered him round so as to lead him back\r\n",

      "with an elder's affection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Cunning indeed! he said. Is it you? You poor poet, you!\r\n",

      "as I have confessed to you so many other things, have I not?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "--Yes, my child, Cranly said, still gaily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for\r\n",
      "another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to\r\n",
